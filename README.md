Aura Text is a notepad app for Windows, completely made with Python. It offers modern look with advanced and some cool features, and I'll explain them all in a minute!

## Features

- Well, edit text files
- Auto Completion (Python only as of v1.1.0)
- Highlighter
- Text Encrypt and Decrypt
- Text to Speech
- Syntax Highlighting
- Auto Indent
- Summary mode to see entire data of your file(s)
- Google search a specific keyword from the notes
- Instantly get article from Wikipedia about the selected word from the notes, without even leaving the app
- Universal dark mode
- Adjust transparency of the window, so that you can copy text from another app without even closing or minimizing the Notes.
- Always on top functionality
- Search for words in sites like Google, Stackoverflow and Github

## Setting Up
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Benchmarks

- Can easily crunch through 100-150MB Text Files with real time translation, highlighting and searching.




## To Do 

- ~~Switch between light and dark themes~~
- ~~New and modern icon (i'm using an generic icon rn... Need to change it ASAP)~~
- Display time and date but in a indistractive and modern way (maybe in a right click menu) (might change it bcz you can just view the time via taskbar.. But what if you're in full-screen mode?)
- Filetree to open files quicker
- File-type recognition 

That's it for right now! Will update more To Do's later... Also, i'll mark them as complete if i implemented the feature!
